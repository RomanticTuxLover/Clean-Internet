# Clean-Internet
A collection of websites on the internet that make it an awful place either by spewing hate speech, having no terms of service and and/or no privacy policy

## Reasons
Many people in 2020 want to browse the internet the way it's supposed to be: free from hate, violence, violent ideologies, illegal content, adult content, and dangerous conspiracy theories. However it is more easy than ever to host a website that spews this garbage
<br />
Some websites even go as far as not giving a privacy policy which explains what data gets collected, and what the site owner does with data they collect. If this is nonexistent, one can only guess what data the site collects from its users. 

## Why Block?
In short...

- You want to keep illegal content (eg. child porn) off your network/computer.
- You want yourself and/or network users to browse the internet more privately
- You don't want to browse the internet while being poisoned with violent ideologies and dangerous conspiracy theories.
- You want yourself and/or your network users to enjoy their browsing experience and not have to worry about being harrassed or have crap flinged at them from people who don't know any better.
- You want people to browse the internet without being in fear of being bullied over their race, religion, gender, hobbies, etc.
- You don't want to allow cults and hate groups to recruit yourself and/or vulnerable network users.

Think of it as a spam filter for harassment, hate and common kinds of illegal content.

This blocklist isn't prescriptive too. Feel free to examine the reasons and each website to see what action is right for you.

## How is This Done?
This blocklist comes in two forms: a hosts file and a domain list. 

- The hosts file can be used on individual computers or a network-wide DNS Sinkhole to prevent the computer for looking up the IP of the domain name and redirecting that domain to localhost preventing the connection from occuring.
- The domain list can be used in a network-wide firewall to block both DNS queries to said site and even the IP address of said site if your firewall is sophisticated enough.
